# 50 Projects in 50 Days – HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This repository is a personal challenge to build 50 mini web projects in 50 days using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- `index.html` – The main HTML file
- `style.css` – The CSS file for styling
- `script.js` – The JavaScript file for interactivity

Projects are named descriptively to reflect their functionality.
